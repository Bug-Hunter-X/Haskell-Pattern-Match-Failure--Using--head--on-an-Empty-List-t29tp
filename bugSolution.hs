The solution is to check if the list is empty before applying `head`. We can use pattern matching or the `null` function to achieve this.

```haskell
myFunction :: [Int] -> Maybe Int
myFunction [] = Nothing  -- Handle empty list case
myFunction (x:_) = Just x  -- Handle non-empty list case

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = []
  let nonEmptyList = [1,2,3]
  print (myFunction emptyList) -- Output: Nothing
  print (myFunction nonEmptyList) -- Output: Just 1
```
This revised version uses `Maybe` to safely handle the case where the list is empty.  If the list is empty, it returns `Nothing`; otherwise, it returns `Just` the head of the list.

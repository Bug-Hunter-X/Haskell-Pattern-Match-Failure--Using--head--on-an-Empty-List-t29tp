This Haskell code attempts to use the `head` function on an empty list, which results in a runtime error.  The `head` function is only defined for non-empty lists. 
```haskell
myFunction :: [Int] -> Int
myFunction xs = head xs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = []
  print (myFunction emptyList) 
```
